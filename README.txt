Hello!
This is my very first major university coding project. It may seem VERY rough code-wise, but please keep in mind this
is the first project I've done at uni and in my first year, and it was supposed to be a group project, but communication
got a bit messed up.
Some background on what it is supposed to represent: this is a COVID research "game". In it, the user is supposed to
pick between two difficult choices while also considering the severity of COVID! It plays across a 6-month span, from
March 2020 t0 September 2020. Our game is supposed to replicate the difficult decision parent of two different
household had to make, and the effect the spend of tight income had on the stress of adults.

You can run the program from the main.py module. I know it is very long (400+ lines of code) but this is a mistake, a very
important mistakes, that I made! It has reminded me with my future coding endeavors not to make a module/interface/class
that long ever again.

Because of time and complexity, we could not incorporate more household types such as single people no children and
couples no children as a constant in out research.

It is important to mention that there are some obvious bugs in the code that somewhat effect the ending of game. They
don't necessarily effect the user, however, it may affect the total amount of money remaining. This game is controlled
by keyboard keys, and we did not have enough time to prohibit going back to a choice the user had already made. For
example, going from March to April and back to March is allowed to happen in the game but shouldn't.

The game will give you all the information you need to play. But, once you click the left/right key to see YOUR
plotted data, it will open in a web browser so PLEASE BE SURE TO GO BACK TO THE GAME POP-IP TO SEE THE EXPECTED
RESULTS. The whole point of this game is to demonstrate that the sensible choices you have to make depending on the
situation effect your sending and stress, so you must compare your info to what we researched.

Technical requirements: you must have plotly and pygame libraries installed. Also, this must be done on a computer
with a functional keyboard.

Thank you and enjoy the game!
